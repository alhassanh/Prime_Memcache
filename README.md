# prime_memcache
Prime app using memcache

We created a prime number checker that uses Memcache, Google User Management, and URL Fetch.

The app is written in PHP.

The app takes a number as input from the user. If it is prime and not already in memcache, it is added to memcache, and if it is not prime then it is not added. If a number checked is already in memcache then it is returned as prime without doing the prime number calculation. User Management offers a greeting if signed in using an email address.
